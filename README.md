- üß± Scalable Design System: Makes it easier to scale the app or introduce new features without visual clutter.
- üéØ Alignment With UX Goals: Ensures spacing, contrast, and readability meet accessibility standards.
- ‚ö° Faster Development: Developers can reference predefined styles instead of guessing, reducing back-and-forth between design and code.
- üß™ Improved Testing and Feedback: Design alignment allows for better user testing and easier design QA.
