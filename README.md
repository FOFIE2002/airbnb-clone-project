### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

#### Defining design properties from a mockup ensures visual consistency and improves development efficiency:
üîÑ Consistency Across UI: Reusing standard colors and typography helps maintain a professional, cohesive look.
üß± Scalable Design System: Makes it easier to scale the app or introduce new features without visual clutter.
üéØ Alignment With UX Goals: Ensures spacing, contrast, and readability meet accessibility standards.
‚ö° Faster Development: Developers can reference predefined styles instead of guessing, reducing back-and-forth between design and code.
üß™ Improved Testing and Feedback: Design alignment allows for better user testing and easier design QA.
