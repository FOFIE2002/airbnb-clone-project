### Importance of Identifying Design Properties

üß± Scalable Design System: Makes it easier to scale the app or introduce new features without visual clutter.

üéØ Alignment With UX Goals: Ensures spacing, contrast, and readability meet accessibility standards.

‚ö° Faster Development: Developers can reference predefined styles instead of guessing, reducing back-and-forth between design and code.

üß™ Improved Testing and Feedback: Design alignment allows for better user testing and easier design QA.
